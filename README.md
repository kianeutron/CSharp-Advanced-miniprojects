⚙️ C# Projects (Advanced)

A collection of advanced C# applications developed for school assignments. These projects feature object-oriented programming, exception handling, and file I/O operations. Designed using Windows Forms and console applications, they simulate real-world logic and demonstrate clean, modular code without relying on databases.

Key Features:
Object-Oriented Programming: All projects follow OOP principles for better code organization and maintainability.

Exception Handling: Proper exception handling for robust and user-friendly error management.

File I/O Operations: Some projects involve reading from and writing to files for data persistence.

Windows Forms & Console Apps: Projects utilize both Windows Forms (for GUI-based applications) and Console Apps (for terminal-based applications).

No Database Integration: These projects do not rely on any databases but simulate real-world logic for various use cases.
